Ktor applications can be self-hosted or hosted on an Application Server. This section shows you how to host Ktor applications externally.

## Running an application in an external host

When you need to run a Ktor application in an independently maintained host (for instance Tomcat), you will need an `application.conf` file
to tell Ktor how to start your application. 

### Defining the configuration

In the resources folder, create a file named `application.conf` with the following contents

```kotlin
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
    }

    application {
        modules = [ my.company.MyApplication.ApplicationKt.main ]
    }
}
```

Replace `my.company.MyApplication` with your application's package, and `ApplicationKt` with the name of the
file your `Application.main` function is contained in.

### Deploying the hosted application

// TODO 

## Running the application from inside the IDE

Running applications in a development environment such as IntelliJ IDEA, is supported by using development engines. 

#### IntelliJ IDEA 

1. Create a new Run Configuration using "Application" as a template
2. For the main class use one of the following engines
  * Netty: use `io.ktor.server.netty.EngineMain` 
  * Jetty: use `io.ktor.server.jetty.EngineMain` 
3. Specify the Module to be used
4. Save the Configuration by giving it a name

Once the configuration is saved, you can now run your application for development/debug purposes from inside IntelliJ IDEA, without having to deploy to a container or setup 
any application servers.

## Use automatic reloading

Ktor can automatically reload the application when changes to the class files are detected, i.e. when you build the Application.
Enable this feature by adding `watch` configuration to `application.conf`:

```groovy
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
        watch = [ my.company ]
    }

    …
}
```
