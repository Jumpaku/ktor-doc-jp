Ktor は Kotlin 1.3 で stable になった Coroutine を多用しています。

Coroutines are a basic Kotlin mechanism (also called `suspend` functions), that among other things allows to do asynchronous programming that is linearly written like plain code
instead of the traditional callback-based approach.

Other modern languages expose a similar, but more specific mechanism called await-async. The Kotlin approach is more generic and flexible and it is less verbose and less error-prone
since the default behaviour when calling an asynchronous (`suspend`) function is to suspend the caller too.

Ktor uses a standard library from JetBrains called [kotlinx.coroutines](/kotlinx/coroutines.html).

Since Ktor is fully asynchronous and intensively uses coroutines, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with those concepts.
