Published 28 Dec 2019 (`1.3.0-rc2`)

Version bumps:
* kotlinx.coroutines `1.3.0` -> `1.3.3`
* Dropwizard: `3.2.4` -> `4.1.0`
* Tomcat: `9.0.10` -> `9.0.29`
* Jetty: `9.4.22.v20191022` -> `9.4.24.v20191120`
* Netty: `4.1.37.Final` -> `4.1.43.Final`
* kotlinx.io -> `0.1.14` -> none

Breaking changes:
* kotlinx.io dependency has been removed, replace imports:
    * `import kotlinx.io.` -> `import io.ktor.utils.io.`
    * `import kotlinx.coroutines.io.` -> `import io.ktor.utils.io.`
* No binary compatibility with 1.2.x.
* Incompatible Gradle metadata version (requires 5.4.1+ for MPP).
* Ktor client's `HttpResponse` deprecated and replaced with the same class from another package.
  * The new response once received is completely consumed and always in-memory saved instance that doesn't require to be closed.
  * The new response is not suitable for response streaming since it is always in-memory so all the content is already consumed.
* `HttpStatement` has been introduced in ktor client to support streaming in `execute()` functions lambda.
  * An instance of `HttpStatement` is a prepared HTTP request that could be executed after created (possibly multiple times).
